## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- desktop -first workflow

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned
I learnt making use of flex to style my page layout, I did the desktop first before designing mobile.
I divided the page into two section divs... when I did the mobele design I noticed that width of the top and middle did not align as espected. I had to use the flex property stretch to make it equal.



### Continued development

using grid instead of flexbox to design the layout

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - this linkk provided insight into flexbox properties and how the can be used to achieve different layout.
